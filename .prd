# agentgui Work Items

## SUMMARY
- ✅ Phase 1: Claude Code Conversation Import - COMPLETE (90 conversations imported)
- 🔄 Phase 2-3: OpenCode Integration - BLOCKED (no persistent conversation storage found)
- ⚠️ Issue #1: Conversation timeout - INVESTIGATED (API performance issue deferred)
- ✅ Issue #2: Message input - VERIFIED (Form is properly wired)
- 📋 10/12 Test categories remain (systematic execution needed)

## ACTIVE 🔄

### Phase 2: OpenCode Integration (PRIORITY 2)
**User Request:** Import all OpenCode conversations and keep them in sync

**Investigation Result:**
- OpenCode does NOT store persistent conversation history like Claude Code
- ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json contains only MCP server config
- No sessions-index.json or history.jsonl found in OpenCode directories
- OpenCode may not persist conversations to filesystem

**Options:**
- [ ] Option A: Implement OpenCode CLI integration to query conversations at runtime (requires OpenCode SDK/API)
- [ ] Option B: Focus on Claude Code import (already complete) and document OpenCode limitation
- [ ] Option C: Create placeholder for future OpenCode support when SDK is available

**Tasks (waiting for approach decision):**
- [ ] Implement OpenCode history loader (if feasible)
- [ ] Merge both sources in database
- [ ] Display merged history in sidebar
- [ ] Support agent type filtering

### Phase 3: Sync & Consistency (PRIORITY 3)
- [ ] File watchers for history changes
- [ ] Auto-import new conversations from CLI
- [ ] Keep GUI database in sync with filesystem
- [ ] Handle conflicts (same conversation in both systems)
- [ ] Implement read-only mode for imported conversations

## ISSUES TO FIX ⚠️

**Issue #1: Timeout on Conversation Selection (DEFERRED)**
- Root cause: displayConversation() calls fetchMessages() API (/static/app.js line 762)
- Likely cause: Slow or failing API call to /api/conversations/{id}/messages
- Deferred: Requires backend performance optimization
- Can test once backend is responsive

## Test Categories Remaining (10 of 12)

- [ ] Category 6: Interactive Forms & Input Validation
- [ ] Category 7: Database Persistence & Recovery
- [ ] Category 8: State Consistency & Validation
- [ ] Category 9: Reconnection & Recovery
- [ ] Category 10: Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Category 11: Performance & Latency
- [ ] Category 12: Multi-Agent & Configuration
